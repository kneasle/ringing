# Introduction

## What is Monument?

Monument is a fast and human-friendly composing engine.

The goal is to **get you compositions that you'll enjoy ringing, as quickly and
easily as possible.**

Within this goal, the two major sub-goals are those **speed** and **usability**.

## Goal #1: Speed

Monument is **really fast**.

Monument is often **orders of magnitude faster** than any other composing program I'm aware of.

The trade-off is that Monument does **not guarantee perfection**: Monument aims to generate _very
good_ all-rounder compositions in massively less time than it would take to run an 'perfect'
exhaustive search.  The logic here is that you almost certainly don't care about absolute perfection;
you want something you will enjoy ringing, and you don't want to have to wait ages to get it.

## Goal #2: Usability

As well as being fast, Monument strives to be pleasant to use.

It doesn't matter how good a composing program is if only tech nerds can work out how to get it to
work.
