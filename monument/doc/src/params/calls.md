# Defining Calls

These parameters specify which calls will be used in generated compositions.

**Contents:**
- [`base_calls`](#base_calls)
- [`bobs_only` and `singles_only`](#bobs_only-and-singles_only)
- [`bob_weight` and `single_weight`](#bob_weight-and-single_weight)
- [`calls` array:](#calls)
  - [`place_notation`](#place_notation)
  - [`symbol`](#symbol)
  - [`debug_symbol`](#debug_symbol)
  - [`label`](#label)
  - [`weight`](#weight)
  - [`calling_positions`](#calling_positions)

## `base_calls`

Lead-end calls which are automatically generated:
```toml
base_calls = "near" # default; 14 bob and 1234 single
# or
base_calls = "far"  # 1(n-2) bob and 1(n-2)(n-1)n single
# or
base_calls = "none" # no base calls, only what you've added
```



## `bobs_only` and `singles_only`

**_(since v0.6.0)_**

If either are `true`, then `base_calls` will only generate that call type.  Setting both `bobs_only`
and `singles_only` to `true` makes no sense and causes an error. By default, both bobs and singles
are generated.



## `bob_weight` and `single_weight`

Sets the score given to the bob/single generated by `base_calls`.  Defaults to `bob_weight = -1.8`,
`single_weight = -2.5`.



## `calls`

**TODO:** Write descriptions for each parameter

Array of custom calls:
```toml
[[calls]]
place_notation = "16"
symbol = "x"
debug_symbol = "x"    # Optional; symbol to use for debugging.  Defaults to same as `symbol`
label = "LE"          # Optional; where in the method to apply the call.  Defaults to "LE"
lead_location = "LE"  # Optional; pre-v0.11.0 name for `label`
weight = -4           # Optional; Score given to each instance of this call.  Defaults to -3
calling_positions = "LIBFVXSMWH" # Optional; defaults to 'LIBFVXSEN...' with 'MWH' added
```

Since _v0.9.0_, calls can go from/to different lead `labels`.  This is useful if, for example, you
want to make sure you only apply some calls to some methods.  The following example adds `16` bobs
only in 8ths place methods, and `14` bobs in 2nds place methods (as in
[Leary's 23](https://complib.org/composition/21607)):

```toml
length = "QP"
methods = [
    { title = "Bristol Surprise Major",     labels = { LE = 0, 8ths = 0 } },
    { title = "Deva Surprise Major",        labels = { LE = 0, 8ths = 0 } },
    { title = "Cambridge Surprise Major",   labels = { LE = 0, 2nds = 0 } },
    { title = "Superlative Surprise Major", labels = { LE = 0, 2nds = 0 } },
]
part_head = "13456782"

base_calls = "none" # Only use our own custom calls
[[calls]]
symbol = ""
debug_symbol = "-"
place_notation = "14"
# '14' bobs go *from* only 2nds place methods, but *to* any method
label = { from = "2nds", to = "LE" }

[[calls]]
symbol = "x"
place_notation = "16"
# '16' bobs go *from* only 8ths place methods, but *to* any method
label = { from = "8ths", to = "LE" }
```

Notice how we're using lead labels `2nds` and `8ths` to control which calls are able to be placed at
the end of a lead of each method.  Also note how all calls lead to `LE`, which means that any method
can follow any call (if the calls didn't change lead location, then 2nds/8ths place methods couldn't
be spliced over a call).
